Vehicle Sales Analysis | SQL Data Cleaning and Manipulation  
- By Tanner Earsley  
- Created 6/9/2025

---

## Project Overview
- Join two separate sales tables, clean duplicates and null values.  
- Remove unnecessary columns and adjust data types for analysis.  
- Perform queries to analyze top buyers, highest product sales locations, and compare sales against averages and past dates.

---

## Query Structure
- Queries are (and must be) run separately and sequentially, especially the initial cleaning queries.  
- Each analysis query or group of queries starts with `-- >>> #_` for easy identification.  
- Comments explain the purpose and steps of each query.

---

## Included Files
- `data_cleaning_script.sql` → Contains all queries with comments and steps.  
- `sales_customer.csv` → First sales dataset.  
- `sales_info.csv` → Second sales dataset.

---

## Notes
- The original dataset source link is lost, but all files needed are included in this repository.  
- The initial dirty dataset was split into two CSVs to demonstrate joining tables on keys.  
- Completed entirely using SQL.
