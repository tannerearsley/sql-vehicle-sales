-- SQL Project #1: Vehicle Sales Analysis: SQL Data Cleaning and Manipulation  
-- By Tanner Earsley
-- Created 6/9/2025
-- 
-- In this project, I will be joining two separate sales tables, combing for duplicate/null values, removing unnecessary columns, and changing data types to prepare for analysis. <br />
-- Then I will perform analysis upon the resultant table. <br />
-- Queries will outline top buyers, locations with greatest product sales, and compare sales figures against averages and previous dates, and more! <br />
<br />
Specifically in this project, each query is meant to be ran separately and distinctly, in order to see the changes made and ensure proper execution order. <br />
<br />
-->>> Indicates the start of a new query or collection of queries, so it should be easy to distinguish where each step of the process begins and ends. <br />

Data Analysis is separated by number into 7 parts, denoted -- >>> #: <br />
Each # Solve a problem determined by the proceeding comment. <br />
